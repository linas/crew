-- add rower conflicts
-- verify that boats requested by name are actually the correct class
   for that race (e.g. we're not entering doubles into quad races).

-- minimize number of boats used
-- minimize number of oar-sets used.
   Yikes! This is a real cpu-sucker!  Need to use incremental
   clingo to solve boat assignments fully before tackling oars,
   otherwise, it gets totally tangled in the oar assignments.

-- split up oar sets for doubles, singles.
   This is currently broken because the oar universe for preferences
   doesn't know about how many are needed, for a given boat class.
