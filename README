                   ----------------------------
                   Version 0.01 -- Linas Vepstas


Pre-requisites
--------------
To use this code, must have clingo, from the potassco project, installed.
In principle, any other answer-set programming system should work,
although only clingo has been tested.

See:  http://potassco.sourceforge.net/

Testing the Example
-------------------
Validate your clingo installation by running the following at the
command line:

   clingo example.asp

The output should resemble the following:
   Answer: 1
   reserve(206,juniors,orange) reserve(206,juniors,green)
   reserve(202,intermediate,red) reserve(201,advanced,orange)
   reserve(201,matt,black) 
   SATISFIABLE

   Models      : 1+    

The above states that the juniors get two quads for race 206: the
heavyweight orange, and the midweight green.  The advanced crew 
got orange for race 201, this will have to be hot-seated.  Matt
gets the black quad for race 201.  And so on.


Running
-------
 * Make a copy of example.asp, giving it some other name, say, for
   example, 'head2012.asp'

 * Edit head2012.asp
   Describe boat classes, boats, crews, equipment requests.

 * Run the software.  To list one possible set of boat assignments
   (if any):

       clingo  head2102.asp

   If its not possible to satisfy all the requests, the program will
   print UNSATISFIABLE.

   To list multiple different boat assignments (4, in this example,
   assuming that there are any at all), enter this:

       clingo 4 head2012.asp


That's all for now, folks!
